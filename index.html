						<p> &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; 20 year old, Second-Year BCom Infromatics University of Pretoria Student &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;

						My name is a not so common Xhosa name but in English its translated to the word 'song' and surprising music and singing are two of my greatest passions, almost as if the name was created and made specifically for me.
						Among singing and a number of stuff, dramatic arts as well as writing is another passion of mine, to the point I've started writing a book and wrote a few plays in high school and co-wrote a few more plays post high school.
					    </br>
                        My parents are my biggest inspirations as they brought me up in a transparent, open and loving home and taught me everything in live and for that, I'll forever be greatful to them.

						&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; I live by the quote by Theodore Roosevelt
